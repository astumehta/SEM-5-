1. ifconfig/ipconfig:  
   - ifconfig: A Linux/Unix command to view or configure network interfaces.  
   - ipconfig: A Windows command to view and manage IP address configurations of the system.

2. ping:  
   - Tests the connectivity between the host and a target device using ICMP (Internet Control Message Protocol) packets. It measures round-trip time and packet loss.

3. nslookup:  
   - A diagnostic tool for querying DNS (Domain Name System) to obtain domain name or IP address mappings.

4. hostname:  
   - Displays or sets the name of the host/computer on the network.

5. netstat:  
   - Displays active network connections, routing tables, and network interface statistics. Useful for monitoring network activity.

6. nbtstat:  
   - A Windows command for troubleshooting NetBIOS name resolution issues and viewing active NetBIOS sessions.

7. net:  
   - A Windows command for managing network resources, such as viewing shared files, starting/stopping services, or managing user accounts (`net use`, `net start`, etc.).

8. tracert:  
   - Tracks the route packets take to reach a destination host by displaying each hop along the path. Known as `traceroute` in Linux/Unix.

9. arp:  
   - Displays or modifies the ARP (Address Resolution Protocol) table, which maps IP addresses to MAC addresses.

10. getmac:  
    - Displays the MAC (Media Access Control) addresses of network adapters on the system.

11. Path ping:  
    - Combines `ping` and `tracert` functionalities. It checks connectivity at every hop along the route to a destination and measures network latency at each point.

12. route:  
    - Displays or modifies the system's routing table. Used to set up static routes or view the paths that packets take to reach different networks.

These commands are foundational for network troubleshooting and management in different operating systems. Let me know if you'd like examples of how to use any specific command!
